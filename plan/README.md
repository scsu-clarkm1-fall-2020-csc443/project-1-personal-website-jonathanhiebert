# Site Plan - hitthepolls.com

## Overview

The aim of hitthepolls.com is to compile a reliable collection of useful voting information for this upcoming Election Day. 

In today's culture, there seems to be this idea that views on political issues are binary. Democrat or Republican, Liberal or Conservative. This ideology can be confusing for many people who find themselves in the middle on certain topics. Additionally, media sources are increasingly unreliable, which forces many to resort to alternatives for of information gathering such as social media. This can lead to false information being spread because of the lack of verification on social media. This site will serve as a one-stop-shop for news about this upcoming election, including the candidates involved, news sources, and basic information about where and how to vote during the pandemic. 

A key feature for the site will be a survey function that will allow users to fill out a survey regarding information about the election. This survey will allow the user to explain who they want to vote for and why, or to ask questions about certain topics. Additionally, the site will contain several pages that outline the election details, candidate comparison, and news source credibility.

## Goals

The primary goals of the site and corresponding objectives are given below.

### Inform the Average American Voter On How and Where to Vote

* Have significantly more people who filled out the survey say they feel more educated about voting information after visiting the site, than people who say they haven't learned more. 
* Have at least 50% of users click the link that sends them to the site to learn more about where to vote for their hometown. 

### Educate Voters on Credible News Sources and Their Biases

* Have more people say they have learned more about news sources and potential biases, than people who say they haven't. 

### Educate Voters About the Candidates and Their Views

* Have significantly more people who filled out the survey say they feel more educated about the candidates after visiting the site, than people who say they haven't learned more.

Erica is a 21-year-old American who usually stays up-to-date on current events and politics. She is in-tune with what has been happening over these last few months leading up to the election. She does struggle with trusting news sources and often uses social media as a news source. She comes to the site looking to learn more about the news sources and how they view things. This will help her get a better understanding of which news sources will be bias towards a certain side or policy.
